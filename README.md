Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repo has R code and docs for JHU course "Getting and Cleaning data".

Data used: (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The data should be placed in the same folder, unzipped and with consistent names.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `averages_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
